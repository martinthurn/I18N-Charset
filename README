                      I18N-Charset Distribution

This distribution contains a module I18N::Charset which maps Character
Set names to the names officially registered with IANA.  For example,
'Shift_JIS' is the official name of what is often referred to in HTML
headers as 'x-sjis'.

It also maps character set names to Unicode::Map, Unicode::Map8, and
Unicode::MapUTF8 conversion scheme names (if those modules are
installed).  For example, the Unicode::Map8 scheme name for
'windows-1251' is 'cp1251'.

It also maps character set names to their preferred MIME names.  For
example, the preferred MIME name for 'ISO_646.irv:1991' is 'US-ASCII'.

It also maps character set names to conversion scheme names as defined
by the iconv library.  For example, the iconv conversion scheme name
for 'Shift_JIS' is 'MS_KANJI'.

It also maps character set names to encoding names as defined
by the Encode module.  For example, the Encode encoding name
for 'Shift_JIS' is 'shiftjis'.

To install these modules, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make test
	% make install

(If you're on a Windows system, you probably use Nmake instead of make.)

The module is documented using pod. When you "make install", you will
get a man page I18N::Charset which can be displayed by "perldoc
I18N::Charset".

Please let me know if you experience any problems with this module, or
have any ideas for additions, or if you have some new character set
names or abbreviations you'd like to be included.
